[Client]
--------

The client program is used to connect with other player over the internet and
play magic games together.
The underlying protocol used is Jabber/XMPP. This is the reason why you need a
jabber account in order to play. There are many free jabber servers on the net,
for example http://www.jabber.org/.
Unlike most other programs of this kind there is no limit how many player can
join in one game.

The client has 5 (hidden) commands:
/life	set the life points
/nick	change one's nick
/draw	draw a number of cards
/flip	flip a coin
/roll	roll a die

'f11' toggles fullscreen

Known issues:
- tray layout is kinda broken
- mouse is not exactly on the card when dragging a card to play
- Enlarged card flicker when the mouse is near the center of the screen
- when just missing a card that is meant to be tapped, everything gets untapped.
  This should be prevented by checking if there is an owned card around.
- the log does not always scroll down
- there is not graphics for the counters


---------
[Updater]
---------

This is a small program for downloading and updating the magic set data and
card pictures. Please read the disclaimer carefully before using it.

Known issues:
- The loyalty of plainswalkers is missing sometimes
- Multiple instances of the program can be run
