[Client]
--------

The client program is used to connect with other player over the internet and
play magic games together.
The underlying protocol used is Jabber/XMPP. This is the reason why you need a
jabber account in order to play. There are many free jabber servers on the net,
for example http://www.jabber.org/.
Unlike most other programs of this kind there is no limit how many player can
join in one game.

The client has 3 (hidden) commands:
/life set the life points
/nick changes the user's nick
/draw draws a number of cards

'f11' toggles fullscreen

Known bugs:
- sometimes cards glitch into play while still being in the hand. this is not
  seen across the network (has no itemid). Appearantly this is caused by fast
  double clicking and then dragging (removed -> card is still changed)
- mouse is not exactly on the card when dragging a card to play
- tray layout is kinda broken
- when just missing a card that is meant to be tapped, everything gets untapped.
  This should be prevented by checking if there is an owned card around.
- Enlarged card flicker when the mouse is near the center of the screen
- If a card is flipped, the enlarged picture is not
- can alter other player's cards on the battlefield
- cannot roll dice of flip coins
- the second card searched from the library is wrong
- fetch card from removed produces error messages
- user list is not updated
- log does not always scroll down
- moving the tray while the deck loads causes the tray to vanish

Desired features:
- save login details
- move cards from/to the graveyard by drag and drop
- play cards face down
- set nick
- search for cards automatically (basic lands...)
- tokens
- counters
- pretty card browser
- comprehensive match logger with colored output
- console commands
- undo untap all
- optimize ram usage (+ ram saving mode)
- Save games
- Replay games
- Handle cards with mixed card sizes
