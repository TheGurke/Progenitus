- Searching for "mana cost >= 2" yields the same results as searching for "converted mana cost >= 2"


Client
------

The client program is used to connect with other player over the internet and
play magic games together.
The underlying protocol used is Jabber/XMPP. This is the reason why you need a
jabber account in order to play. There are many free jabber servers on the net,
for example http://www.jabber.org/.
Unlike most other programs of this kind there is no limit how many player can
join in one game.

The client has 5 commands:
/life #			set the life points
/draw #			draw a number of cards
/flip			flip a coin
/roll			roll a six-sided die

Known issues

- cannot join again using the same account
- when watching a replay, playing, pausing and seeking backwards do not work
- no feedback in case of wrong password
- tray card number is not updated correctly
- mouse is not exactly on the card when dragging a card to play
- enlarged card flickers when the mouse is near the center of the screen
- when just missing a card that is meant to be tapped, everything gets untapped.
  This should be prevented by checking if there is an owned card around.


Updater
-------

This is a program for downloading and updating the magic set data and card
pictures. Please read the disclaimer carefully before using it.


Known issues

- The loyalty of plainswalkers is missing sometimes
- Expanding the download log crashes the updater (therefore currently hidden)
