Updater:
- Rewritten most of the updater's code in oder to handle the Innistrad cards.
  (The non-numeric characters in the collector's id caused trouble.)
  Because of this, the database format changed and therefore the card
  information will have to be downloaded again.
- Fixed: Updater longer crashes upon completion.

Editor:
- Fixed: New deck doesn't remove the color symbols
- Fixed: Show expansion breaks when window is closed once
- Fixed: Author and description entries are not disabled while deck is loading
- Fixed: Cannot use power/thoughness based search since they are text fields in
  the db
- Fixed: Searching for colors and lands at the same time is broken
- Fixed: Sorting by mana cost does not cluster colors where converted costs are
  the same
- Fixed: Deck renaming issues

Client:
- Changed network protocol; Now broadcasting client version and sending
  card names in addition to ids.
